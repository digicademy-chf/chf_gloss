CHF Gloss
=========

The extension provides a data model for glossary data, as part of the Cultural
Heritage Framework (CHF). It can be included in various data resources across
the CHF. A glossary consists mainly of a central resource and its entries. The
latter may annotate a set of words or abbreviations. Their definitions may
only contain minimal formatting. Authorship can be attributed to the entire
resource instead of individual entries.
