Introduction

The extension allows you to build a glossary in your TYPO3 project. It can be
used to embed abbreviation tags (for abbreviations) and info buttons (for
term definitions) in other data models of the Cultural Heritage Framework
(CHF). Definitions are supposed to be very brief and do not include images or
other files. The extension is part of the CHF, which provides additional
functionality such as dictionary or encyclopedia entries, labels to structure
data, and various additional data models.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
